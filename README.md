**Java Program** to develop Swing GUI based *STANDARD CALCULATOR*.
In this program I had created an GUI based calculator using the Swing.
The simple mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulus are provided for user. 
With the help of the above provided code which is written purely in Java Programming Language you can get an idea of desiging of Calculator with GUI based interface...

## Swing :
  Swing API is set of extensible GUI Components to ease developer's life to create JAVA based Front End/ GUI Applications. It is build upon top of AWT API and acts as replacement of AWT API as it has almost every control corresponding to AWT controls.

## Algorithm:
1. Create a class that implements ActionListener.
2. Create frame by creating object of JFrame class.
3. Create buttons and text field using the JButton and JTextField class.
4. Using setBounds methods specify location of the buttons and textField in the frame.
5. Add the buttons and textfield in the frame using frame class object.
6. In actionPerformed method define actions to be performed when buttons are pressed.
7. If button pressed is equal button perform appropriate function and display results in textfield.
